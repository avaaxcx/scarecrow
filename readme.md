# üê¶ Scarecrow

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/lukewhrit/scarecrow)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/lukewhrit/scarecrow) [![Documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/lukewhrit/scarecrow)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/lukewhrit/scarecrow)

Scarecrow is a simple static site generator.

The entire idea behind Scarecrow is that it **stays out of your way**. Often static site generators are just far too complex, including a plethora of features and folders that you really don't need.

**Abilities and Features:**

* Easy to customize.
* Allows you to write your site's content in Markdown. 
* Built-in blogging support.
* Supports Go's `html/template` in Markdown.
* Compiles down to purely static files; JavaScript-free.
* Fast; Scarecrow compiles sites faster than Hugo or Jekyll.

## Installation

Scarecrow is alpha software, it shouldn't be used in production. However, you can still install Scarecrow right now and use it if you wish. Use this command: 

```
$ go get -v -u github.com/lukewhrit/scarecrow
```

## Directory Structure

Scarecrow uses a very simple directory structure that allows for easy customization and development. The only required files are `layout.html` and `pages/index.md`.

```
.
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ posts/
 ‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hello-world.md
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/
 ‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contact.md
 ‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.md
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.html
```

`pages/index.md` is pretty ordinary, `layout.html` however has some special things going on with it. `layout.html` serves as the base HTML file for all content on your site. You should define the styles and layout of your site here.

Scarecrow will inject your sites content into this file wherever it finds a `<scarecrow-body>` or `<scarecrow-body />` tag.

Scarecrow does not yet support custom layouts per file. We are interested in possibly implementing this in the future.

## TODO

* [ ] Blogging support.
* [X] Use `layout.html` to determine file content and output to a `dist/` directory.
* [ ] Pass to `html/template` before outputting.
* [ ] Front matter support and parsing.
* [X] HTML output minifying.
* [X] Automatically create required directories on output.
